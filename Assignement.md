# Assignment 

The assignment for the ETIC Design course is a folder named ["yourFirstName_YourLaseName"] 
The folder should contain 3 visualization “ideal” mockup and 2 or 3 mockup of the final website:
* Timeline, named ["timeline_number"]
* Argument map, named ["argument_number"] 
* Stakeholder map, named ["stakeholder_number"] 
* 2 to 3 screens of the final website mock up, named ["website_number"] 
* an access to the dataset you have received

For each mockup I am expecting at least one picture, at most five pictures.
Each picture should be a PNG file with minimal size of 1280x1024 pixels. 
The PNG file should contains a representation of **all the data have to be represented**, it is not a sketch.If you have an interactive visual representation just show the main interactive steps. If you want you can provide an annotated mockup with the original version in order to better explain your work.
For each mockup I am expecting a text file with the same name than the mockup.
The text file should contain a short paragraph of 10 lines minimum to explain: 
* What are your design choices?
* What is the encoding between the data and the visual?
* What is the interesting information a viewer can understand from the visual representation?
* What is the abstract task a user can process with this diagram?

Warning: Do not forget each data representation mockup should contain at least: 
* a representation 
* a title 
* a legend 
* a caption that explains the story of the representation 

I am expecting you to deliver theses elements into the following shared repository:
